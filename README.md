## What is this repository?
This repository contains the work I did in Dr. Jordan Lingo's *in silico* biology lab for the Fall 2024 semester. Please view the html file containing my findings for the semester.

**SPOILER** The analysis did not find anything useful but there are some cool data visualizations of the distribution of locations where ligands bind to various olfactory receptors of insects.

The data was calculated in R, file type is rmd so github is not recognizing it as R, but that is how the analysis was done. Chop.py is just a script to clean the data.
